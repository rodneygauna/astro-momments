## 🎮 Game Overview

Navigate your tiny spaceship through the depths of space, collecting asteroids with your collection field. The longer an asteroid stays within your field, the closer you are to collecting it! But be careful—asteroids can escape if they leave your radius, and your collection ability changes as you move.

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Mine** - Navigate your spaceship to collect drifting asteroids
2. **Earn** - Convert collected asteroids into currency
3. **Upgrade** - Improve your spaceship's speed, field radius, and collection abilities
4. **Repeat** - Collect even more asteroids in the next round!

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Physics-Based Movement** - Realistic spaceship controls with momentum and turning penalties
- **Collection Meter System** - Progressive asteroid collection with visual feedback
- **Smart Spawning** - Asteroids spawn dynamically with smooth ease-in animations
- **Upgrade System** - Enhance your spaceship's capabilities between rounds
- **Circular Play Area** - Navigate within a contained space sector
- **Camera Follow** - Smooth camera tracking for optimal gameplay

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls

- **W / Up Arrow** - Move forward
- **A / Left Arrow** - Move left
- **S / Down Arrow** - Move backward
- **D / Right Arrow** - Move right

### Tips

- Keep asteroids inside your cyan collection field to fill their meter
- Sharp turns slow you down—plan your movements!
- Moving reduces your collection radius, so stop to collect more efficiently
- Watch the collection meter above each asteroid to track your progress

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/) (version 11.5 or higher)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodneygauna/astro-moments.git
   cd astro-moments
   ```

2. **Run the game**

   ```bash
   love .
   ```

   Or drag the folder onto the LÖVE executable.

## � Save Files

Your game progress is automatically saved when you:

- Complete a mining run and earn currency
- Purchase upgrades
- Unlock new sectors

### Save File Location

Astro Moments uses LÖVE's filesystem, which stores save files in platform-specific directories:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/love/astro-moments/player_save.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/LOVE/astro-moments/player_save.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/LOVE/astro-moments/player_save.json`

The save file is in JSON format, making it human-readable and easy to backup or transfer between systems.
