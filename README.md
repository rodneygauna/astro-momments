## 🎮 Game Overview

Navigate your tiny boat through peaceful waters, catching fish with your capture ring. The longer a fish stays within your ring, the closer you are to catching it! But be careful—fish can escape if they leave your radius, and your catching ability changes as you move.

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Fish** - Navigate your boat to catch swimming fish
2. **Earn** - Convert caught fish into currency
3. **Upgrade** - Improve your boat's speed, radius, and capture abilities
4. **Repeat** - Catch even more fish in the next round!

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Physics-Based Movement** - Realistic boat controls with momentum and turning penalties
- **Capture Meter System** - Progressive fish catching with visual feedback
- **Smart Spawning** - Fish spawn dynamically with smooth ease-in animations
- **Upgrade System** - Enhance your boat's capabilities between rounds
- **Circular Play Area** - Navigate within a contained aquatic zone
- **Camera Follow** - Smooth camera tracking for optimal gameplay

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls

- **W / Up Arrow** - Move forward
- **A / Left Arrow** - Move left
- **S / Down Arrow** - Move backward
- **D / Right Arrow** - Move right

### Tips

- Keep fish inside your red capture ring to fill their meter
- Sharp turns slow you down—plan your movements!
- Moving reduces your capture radius, so stop to catch more efficiently
- Watch the capture meter above each fish to track your progress
